Hi there! Here's some scripts I use to run my Minecraft server, feel free to suggest improvements.

To use my scripts:

1. Clone the repo.
2. Create a branch for your world-specific files (e.g. ops.txt, minecraft_server.jar), add those.
3. [Optional] Change the directory in the backup script, if you intend to use it.
4. Execute "./run_server.sh" and enjoy.

The scripts are as follows:

run_server.sh:
  Spawns a screen session named "minecraft", starts Java running with some tuned parameters.

stop_server.sh:
  Stops the server gracefully (which ends the screen session).

mc_backup.sh:
  Quiesce the server (save-off, save-all), do a git commit of the world files, let the server go (save-on). I run a cron job to do this nightly. You will need to change the directory to where your server lives, naturally.

update_server.sh:
  Grab the latest minecraft_server.jar (stop the server first!).
